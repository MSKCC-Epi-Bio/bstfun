\usage{
add_variable_grouping(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a gtsummary table}

\item{...}{named arguments. The name is the group label that will be inserted
into the table. The values are character names of variables that will be grouped}
}
\value{
a gtsummary table
}
\description{
Some data are inherently grouped, and should be reported together.
For example, one person likely belongs to multiple racial groups and
the results of these tabulations
belong in a grouped portion of a summary table.

Grouped variables are all indented together. The label row is a single
indent, and the other rows are double indented.
}
\section{Warning}{

While the returned table is the same class as the input, it does not follow
the structure expected in other gtsummary functions that accept
these objects: errors may occur.
