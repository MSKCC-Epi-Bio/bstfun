## Data Version Control
- Save data in a secure folder on a network drive with a subfolder indicating date data was received.
  - e.g. `"H:/ ... /Project Folder/secure_data/{{Sys.Date()}}/data_set.csv"`
- The file `data_date.txt` refers to the date folder in the `"secure_data"` folder. When new data arrives, save it in a new date folder and update `data_date.txt`.
- Use `bstfun::here_data()` to locate current data folder based on `data_date.txt`.
